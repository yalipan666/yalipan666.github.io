# Natural Reading  
### 8. Lexical Word Processing is Unaffected by Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging in Reading: Evidence from Eye Movements  
Prigorkina, V., Sheridan, H., Frisson, S., & Pan, Y. (*) (2025, September 9, under review).   
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/jbsdk_v1)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/bk52w/)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://osf.io/bk52w/)       
Supervised a master's student project. Here, we tried to address a fundamental question about the validity of RIFT: does high-frequency flicker alter eye movement patterns during reading? By analysing both the amplitude and latency of the classic word frequency effect, we found the answer to be no. Through careful experimental design and thorough data analysis, this study provides strong evidence for the validity of RIFT. RIFT opens up new possibilities for measuring attention in active vision, remaining imperceptible to participants and causing no interference with ongoing processing.  
### 7. Parallel and dynamic attention allocation during natural reading   
Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., Snell, J., Federmeier, K. D., & Jensen, O. (2025, bioRxiv, under review)  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.27.656336v1.full.pdf)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yalipan666/Attention_in_Reading)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/250316)       
Using RIFT, we tagged two adjacent words with two different frequencies and observed neural evidence for both the lexical parafoveal effect (replicating our Nat Comm 2021 findings) and the foveal load effect. Importantly, we observed a dynamic shift of attention between foveal and parafoveal processing, depending on the processing demands of the currently fixated word. This flexible allocation of attentional resources appears to be key to fluent reading.    
### 6. Emotional content interacts with word frequency during parafoveal reading  
Naveed, T., Evans, A., Ferrante, O., & Pan, Y. (*) (2024, unver review)    
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5002588)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/9zcje/files/osfstorage?view_only=)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://osf.io/9zcje/files/osfstorage?view_only=)      
Supervised an undergrad student project. This time, we investigated parafoveal processing from the perspective of emotion. We found an intricate interaction between emotion and word frequency in parafoveal processing, a region where attentional resources are highly limited. This striking result underscores the processing priority of emotional information even when attention is constrained.    
### 5. Fast hierarchical processing of orthographic and semantic parafoveal information during natural reading    
Wang, L., Frisson, S., Pan, Y. (*), & Jensen, O. (accepted by Nature Communications)   
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.27.615440v1.full.pdf)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/rnx89/)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://osf.io/rnx89/)       
Co-supervised PhD project. We applied Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to decode word representations at both  orthographic and semantic levels, at different temporal latencies and in different brain regions. Crucially, this decoding was performed for parafoveal words, demonstrating RSA as an additional tool, alongside RIFT, for investigating parafoveal processing during reading.     
### 4. Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading   
Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., Federmeier, D. K., Jensen, O. (2024, eLife, 12, RP91327)    
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/91327)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yalipan666/Semantic)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/149801)     
We found that semantic violations occur before direct word fixation using the Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) method, challenging the classic N400 time window for semantic processing.  
### 3.  Saccades are locked to the phase of alpha oscillations during natural reading  
Pan, Y. (*), Popov, T., Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2023, PLoS Biology, 21(1), e3001968)  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001968)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yalipan666/Saccade-Alpha-phase)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/117885)      
Showed that oculomotor activity in reading is not noise but plays a critical role in word processing by phase-locking to endogenous alpha oscillations. This opens new avenues to understand the functional roles of neuronal oscillations in naturalistic scenarios involving eye movements.    
### 2.  An oscillatory pipelining mechanism supporting previewing during visual exploration and reading   
Jensen, O., Pan, Y., Frisson, S., & Wang, L. (2021, Trends in Cognitive Sciences. 25(12), 1033-1044)

### 1.  Neural evidence for lexical parafoveal processing    
Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2021, Nature Communications, 12(1), 1-9)  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25571-x)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/ard6h/)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/117885)   
We propose a new technique, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), to measure attention during reading, establishing a novel paradigm for studying attention in active vision.
