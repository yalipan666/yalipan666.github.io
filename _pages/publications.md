Natural Reading

* [1] Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., Federmeier, D. K., Jensen, O. (2024). Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading. eLife, 12, RP91327.
  * We found that semantic violations occur before direct word fixation using the Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) method, challenging the classic N400 time window for semantic processing.
* [2] Pan, Y. (*), Popov, T., Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2023). Saccades are locked to the phase of alpha oscillations during natural reading. PLoS Biology, 21(1), e3001968.
  * Showed that oculomotor activity in reading is not noise but plays a critical role in word processing by phase-locking to endogenous alpha oscillations. This opens new avenues to understand the functional roles of neuronal oscillations in naturalistic scenarios involving eye movements.
* [3] Jensen, O., Pan, Y., Frisson, S., & Wang, L. (2021). An oscillatory pipelining mechanism supporting previewing during visual exploration and reading. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. 25(12), 1033-1044.
* [4] Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2021). Neural evidence for lexical parafoveal processing. Nature Communications, 12(1), 1-9.
  * We propose a new technique, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), to measure attention during reading, establishing a novel paradigm for studying attention in active vision.
