# Natural Reading  
### 8. Lexical Word Processing is Unaffected by Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging in Reading: Evidence from Eye Movements  
Prigorkina, V., Sheridan, H., Frisson, S., & Pan, Y. (*) (2025, September 9, under review)   
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/jbsdk_v1)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/bk52w/)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://osf.io/bk52w/)       
Supervised a master's student project. Here, we tried to address a fundamental question about the validity of RIFT: does high-frequency flicker alter eye movement patterns during reading? By analysing both the amplitude and latency of the classic word frequency effect, we found the answer to be no. Through careful experimental design and thorough data analysis, this study provides strong evidence for the validity of RIFT. RIFT opens up new possibilities for measuring attention in active vision, remaining imperceptible to participants and causing no interference with ongoing processing.  
### 7. Parallel and dynamic attention allocation during natural reading   
Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., Snell, J., Federmeier, K. D., & Jensen, O. (2025, bioRxiv, under review)  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.27.656336v1.full.pdf)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yalipan666/Attention_in_Reading)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/250316)       
Using RIFT, we tagged two adjacent words with two different frequencies and observed neural evidence for both the lexical parafoveal effect (replicating our Nat Comm 2021 findings) and the foveal load effect. Importantly, we observed a dynamic shift of attention between foveal and parafoveal processing, depending on the processing demands of the currently fixated word. This flexible allocation of attentional resources appears to be key to fluent reading.    
### 6. Emotional content interacts with word frequency during parafoveal reading  
Naveed, T., Evans, A., Ferrante, O., & Pan, Y. (*) (2024, under review)    
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5002588)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/9zcje/files/osfstorage?view_only=)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://osf.io/9zcje/files/osfstorage?view_only=)      
Supervised an undergrad student project. This time, we investigated parafoveal processing from the perspective of emotion. We found an intricate interaction between emotion and word frequency in parafoveal processing, a region where attentional resources are highly limited. This striking result underscores the processing priority of emotional information even when attention is constrained.    
### 5. Fast hierarchical processing of orthographic and semantic parafoveal information during natural reading    
Wang, L., Frisson, S., Pan, Y. (*), & Jensen, O. (accepted by Nature Communications)   
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.27.615440v1.full.pdf)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/rnx89/)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://osf.io/rnx89/)       
Co-supervised PhD project. We applied Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to decode word representations at both  orthographic and semantic levels, at different temporal latencies and in different brain regions. Crucially, this decoding was performed for parafoveal words, demonstrating RSA as an additional tool, alongside RIFT, for investigating parafoveal processing during reading.     
### 4. Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading   
Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., Federmeier, D. K., Jensen, O. (2024, eLife, 12, RP91327)    
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/91327)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yalipan666/Semantic)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/149801)     
We found that semantic violations occur before direct word fixation using the Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) method, challenging the classic N400 time window for semantic processing.  
### 3.  Saccades are locked to the phase of alpha oscillations during natural reading  
Pan, Y. (*), Popov, T., Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2023, PLoS Biology, 21(1), e3001968)  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001968)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yalipan666/Saccade-Alpha-phase)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/117885)      
Showed that oculomotor activity in reading is not noise but plays a critical role in word processing by phase-locking to endogenous alpha oscillations. This opens new avenues to understand the functional roles of neuronal oscillations in naturalistic scenarios involving eye movements.    
### 2.  An oscillatory pipelining mechanism supporting previewing during visual exploration and reading   
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661321002254)     
Jensen, O., Pan, Y., Frisson, S., & Wang, L. (2021, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 25(12), 1033-1044)   
Developed a neuroscience framework to explain how the human brain can process the currently fixated item (e.g., images, words) alongside the to-be-fixated item, while avoiding interference between foveal and parafoveal representations. We propose that this is achieved by encoding the two representations in different phases of the alpha cycle â€” an alpha-oscillation-based pipelining mechanism.    
### 1.  Neural evidence for lexical parafoveal processing    
Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2021, Nature Communications, 12(1), 1-9)  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25571-x)    |    ðŸ’» [Code](https://osf.io/ard6h/)    |    ðŸ’¾ [datasets](https://figshare.com/account/mycontent/projects/117885)   
Proposed a new technique, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), to measure attention during reading. Using this method, we showed that readers engage in substantial pre-processing of a word before fixating on it, including extracting lexical information (i.e., word frequency information), which facilitates subsequent processing. This work establishes a novel paradigm for studying attention in active vision, such as natural reading and visual search.

### 4. Anterior thalamic stimulation improves working memory precision judgments
Liu, J., Yu, T., Wu, J., Pan, Y., Tan, Z., Liu, R., Wang, X., Ren, L., & Wang, L. (2021, Brain stimulation 14 (5), 1073-1080)      
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X21001443)       
Investigated the role of the hippocampalâ€“anterior thalamic pathway in working memory precision by delivering intracranial electrical stimulation to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT). We found that ANT stimulation enhanced working memory precision (i.e., not the number of items remembered, but the clarity and accuracy of those memories). Working with epilepsy patients provided a unique opportunity to conduct invasive (yet safe) brain stimulation and test the causal relationship between a specific brain region and a specific cognitive function.     
### 3. Neural activity is dynamically modulated by memory load during the maintenance of spatial objects       
Pan, Y., Tan, Z., Gao, Z., Li, Y., & Wang, L. (2018, Frontiers in psychology, 9, 1071)      
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01071/full)       
My first neuroscience project used scalp EEG to investigate the effect of working memory load (i.e., the number of items maintained in mind) on brain activity. We found that neural responses did not change linearly with memory load but instead showed dynamic modulation. In addition, occipital alpha power decreased with increasing load, supporting the functional role of alpha oscillations in "gating by inhibition".     
### 2. Lateral prefrontal cortex triggers bistable perception switching using human intracranial EEG     
Xu, H., Qin, C., Bai, Y., Tan, Z., Pan, Y., Li, Y., Zhou, W., Zhang, T., & Wang, L. (2016, Advances in Psychological Science, 24 (Suppl.), 24)       
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://journal.psych.ac.cn/adps/EN/abstract/abstract3658.shtml)        
Investigated neural circuits underlying bistable perception in epilepsy patients with intracranial electrodes while performing a structure-from-motion task. We found that increased high-gamma activity in the lateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices preceded perceptual switches, supporting a top-down processing model in which the prefrontal cortex can trigger perceptual alternations independently of hMT+ activity.
### 1. Role of neural oscillations in maintenance of human visual working memory representations     
Pan, Y., & Wang, L. (2016, Chinese Science Bulletin 61 (15), 1650-1660).      
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://www.sciengine.com/CSB/doi/10.1360/N972015-01244)       
Conducted a literature review on the functional role of neural oscillations in working memory, focusing on both single-frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and cross-frequency coupling. This review laid the foundation for my PhD project, in which I applied a delayed-match-to-sample paradigm to investigate the maintenance of visual working memory. I collected intracranial datasets from over 30 epilepsy patients for this project (the datasets will be shared publicly in the near future)

Developed a toolbox to automatically and precisely extract, localise, and visualise intracranial electrodes in patients with intractable epilepsy using pre-operative MRI and post-operative CT. The toolbox further allows electrode labelling according to multiple brain atlases. It is among the first tools to standardise the localisation and labelling of intracranial EEG electrodes, thereby facilitating automation and improving consistency in intracranial EEG research.
