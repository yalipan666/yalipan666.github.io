# Natural Reading  
## 1. [Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., Federmeier, D. K., Jensen, O. (2024). Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading. eLife, 12, RP91327.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/91327)
    ### * We found that semantic violations occur before direct word fixation using the Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) method, challenging the classic N400 time window for semantic processing.
## 1.  [Pan, Y. (*), Popov, T., Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2023). Saccades are locked to the phase of alpha oscillations during natural reading. PLoS Biology, 21(1), e3001968.](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001968)
    ### * Showed that oculomotor activity in reading is not noise but plays a critical role in word processing by phase-locking to endogenous alpha oscillations. This opens new avenues to understand the functional roles of neuronal oscillations in naturalistic scenarios involving eye movements.

## 1.  [Pan, Y. (*), Frisson, S., & Jensen, O. (2021). Neural evidence for lexical parafoveal processing. Nature Communications, 12(1), 1-9.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25571-x)
    ### * We propose a new technique, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), to measure attention during reading, establishing a novel paradigm for studying attention in active vision.
